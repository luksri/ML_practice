The secondary objective is to collect information on the pattern of side effects with use of colestipol HCL after teriflunomide administration and to determine the best duration of therapy needed for adequate elimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 We hypothesize that colestipol HCL will have the same elimination timing as cholestyramine (current approved elimination procedure).\n",

      "## Background\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 Teriflunomide is a novel, once-daily, oral disease-modifying therapy approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Teriflunomide exerts its effect by selectively and reversibly inhibiting dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis [1]. This enzyme inhibition results in an impairment of the proliferation of stimulated T and B lymphocytes owing to their need of de novo pyrimidine synthesis to undergo expansion. The salvage pathway for pyrimidine synthesis are relatively unaffected by teriflunomide therefore slowly dividing or resting cells are able to proceed with pyrimidine synthesis. Teriflunomide has a rapid absorption and is extensively bound to plasma protein (&gt;99%). Teriflunomide is moderately metabolized and eliminated mainly through direct biliary excretion of unchanged drug via the feces. Given that it is highly protein bound and involved in enterohepatic recycling, teriflunomide has a long median terminal half-life of 19 days. This results in an extremely slow elimination from plasma, which on average takes 6-8 months but can take up to 2 years for teriflunomide plasma concentrations to reach a minimum level. If a participant needs an accelerated elimination of teriflunomide, the oral administration of cholestyramine, an anion-exchange resin, or activated charcoal can be administered [2]. This has been shown to be effective because cholestyramine and activated charcoal can bind to unbound teriflunomide forming insoluble complexes leading to these becoming sequestered in the small intestine and eventually excreted in feces. By preventing their reabsorption, this process results in the partial removal of unbound teriflunomide and bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colestipol hydrochloride is bile acid sequestrant, similar to cholestyramine [3]. Colestipol hydrochloride has the potential to exert a similar effect on unbound teriflunomide given its similarity to cholestyramine. Colestipol hydrochloride has the potential advantage over cholestyramine in its ease of administration given that it can be dosed as a daily or twice daily regimen where as cholestyramine is typically dosed as three times a day. Another potential advantage is that colestipol is available in an oral tablet formulation where as cholestyramine is supplied as an oral powder for suspension [3].\n",
