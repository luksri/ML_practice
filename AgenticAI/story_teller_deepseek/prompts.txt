models:
1. deepseek r1 1.5b --> not meeting expectations for summary
2. llama2 13b --> promoising summary 



As a text summary:
1. using llama2 13b (for both embedding and query) --> model is hallucinating.
    ex: 
    The drug under study is teriflunomide, an oral medication that works by inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. 
    This enzyme plays a key role in the synthesis of nucleotides, which are essential for cell growth and division. 
    By blocking the activity of this enzyme, teriflunomide can slow down the growth of cancer cells and potentially 
    treat the condition. However, there is also a risk of adverse events, such as nausea, diarrhea, and liver damage, 
    which will be closely monitored throughout the study.

    ---> for this summary, actual document doesnt say anything about cancer.
